# The-Impact-of-Lifestyle-on-Sleep-Health-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project explores how various lifestyle factors influence sleep health. By analyzing a dataset containing sleep duration, quality of sleep, stress levels, physical activity, BMI, and other metrics, the project uncovers key insights and trends. The results are presented using interactive Power BI dashboards, offering actionable recommendations for improving sleep quality and overall well-being.  

Key Insights  
- BMI and Sleep Disorders: Higher BMI categories are linked to more sleep disorders, highlighting the role of weight in sleep health.  
- Occupational Activity and Stress: Occupations like nursing and teaching show higher physical activity but are also associated with increased stress levels, affecting sleep quality.  
- Age and Sleep Duration: Younger adults (27â€“44) sleep longer compared to older adults, reflecting age-related lifestyle and health changes.  
- Stress and Sleep Quality: Elevated stress levels correlate with poor sleep quality, particularly in high-stress professions.  
- BMI and Overall Health: Normal BMI categories exhibit balanced heart rates and sleep durations, indicating better overall health.  

Recommendations  
- Promote regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy BMI to improve sleep quality and reduce sleep disorders.  
- Implement stress management programs for high-stress occupations like nursing and teaching.  
- Encourage routine health monitoring, especially for individuals in higher BMI categories or high-stress roles.  
- Provide sleep education programs for older adults to mitigate age-related sleep issues.  
- Introduce workplace wellness programs, including daily step challenges and stress-relief initiatives, to enhance overall well-being.
